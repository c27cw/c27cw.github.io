<p>
	Last class we linked our folder to the internet through terminal. We created github accounts. 
</p>

<ol>
	<li>
		after opening terminal, type cd ./desktop/c27cw.github.io to enter my folder
	</li>
	<li>
		to check if changes were made to my folder type <u>git status</u> which shows all changes made
	</li>
	<li>
		To add all changes type <b>git add .</b>
	</li>
	<li>
		Then commit changes and add a meessage of what I did <b>git commit -m "message"</b>
	</li>
	<li>

	</li>

</ol>

<h1>
	Journal Entry Number Two
</h1>
	<p>
		In class we were taught how to change font types and access google fonts. I changed to EB Garamond, text can affect any specific texts or entire body. 
	</p>
<h1>
	Journal Entry Number Three
</h1>
	<p>
		I worked outside of class to create an animation of a box opening and capture the first frame so that the box would start out closed and opening on a click. I then worked on getting the box to turn into a link only after the animation has played.
	</p>
	<h1>
	Journal Entry Number Four
</h1>
	<p>
		This class taught us how to make animations with different divs in css, I made a square animation as my first project, with a link to it in projects and a little square image to symbolize the project.
	</p>
	<h1>
	Journal Entry Number Five
</h1>
	<p>
		We learned how to format EventListeners this class, I drew out ideas for what my halloween project could be.
	</p>
<h1>
	Journal Entry Number Six
</h1>
	<p>
		I learned Adobe Illustrate to make an animation for my halloween project, not exactly a jumpscare. I learned different frames and animated a person, now pushed and under projects as my second project! I tried to make an image div to represent this one in class, but it won't show up, I'll come back to see what's going on.

		Today we screenshared people's websites. We are now defining functions to further our understanding of them and to better utilize them in JS.
