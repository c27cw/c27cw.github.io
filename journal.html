	</li>
	<li>
		To add all changes type <b>git add .</b>
	</li>

<h1>
	Journal Entry Number Two
</h1>
	<p>
		In class we were taught how to change font types and access google fonts. I changed to EB Garamond, text can affect any specific texts or entire body. 
	</p>
<h1>
	Journal Entry Number Three
</h1>
	<p>
		I worked outside of class to create an animation of a box opening and capture the first frame so that the box would start out closed and opening on a click. I then worked on getting the box to turn into a link only after the animation has played.
	</p>
	<h1>
	Journal Entry Number Four
</h1>
	<p>
		This class taught us how to make animations with different divs in css, I made a square animation as my first project, with a link to it in projects and a little square image to symbolize the project.
	</p>
	<h1>
	Journal Entry Number Five
</h1>
	<p>
		We learned how to format EventListeners this class, I drew out ideas for what my halloween project could be.
	</p>
<h1>
	Journal Entry Number Six
</h1>
	<p>
		I learned Adobe Illustrate to make an animation for my halloween project, not exactly a jumpscare. I learned different frames and animated a person, now pushed and under projects as my second project! I tried to make an image div to represent this one in class, but it won't show up, I'll come back to see what's going on.

	Journal Entry Number 7 (11/10/23)
</h1>
	<p>
		Today we screenshared people's websites. We are now defining functions to further our understanding of them and to better utilize them in JS. 
	</p>
<h1>
	Journal Entry Number 8 (11/19/23)
</h1>
	<p>
		I added a square full of images of my dad, and parts of his identity. I titled each separate div "Dad" followed by sequential numbering from 1 to 9. I place through top and left each div in a square spacing. I set the opacity of all divs to 0 in style. I then created an event listener for clicks where whenever I clicked it would add one to a variable number, and use the value of that variable each time to pick out the div with that number, and change its opacity to 1. This allowed each click to reveal the next div. Lastly, I set limitations on the variable so that it would not go above the nine divs I had.
	</p>
	<h1>
		Journal Entry Number 9 (12/13/23)
	</h1>
	<p>
		I allowed for a functioning project in which you have an empty tortilla that you can fill with salsa, by clicking on the salsa bowl and then placing salsa wherever you want on the screen. I made use of eventlisteners and variables to tell when the salsa bowl was clicked on, then I used another eventlistener for clicks to figure out where to place the salsa, and if it should be place.
	</p>
	<h1>
		Journal Entry Number 10 (1/10/24)
	</h1>
	<p>
		I tested out arrays in JS, and created an array of nicknames for the infamous Evan Kim. I utilised a random number generator and multiplied it to randomly pick a number between the ranges of 0-9, which was then rounded to an integer. This random int 0-9 was then input as the return key for my array, which allowed me to randomly return a nickname from within my array.
	</p>
	<h1>
		Journal Entry Number 11 (2/14/24)
	</h1>
	<p>
		I finally linked a bunch of my random testing and projects in index.html and worked on input testing in input.html. 
	</p>
	<h1>
		Journal Entry Number 12 on Array Project
	</h1>
	<p>
		I created an array based project to give a nickname for Evan. It has one array with possible nicknames and uses math.random to randomly pick a value from that array. It then assigned three of these random names to be displayed within divs upon clicking, like a slot machine. I also added an if statement to check if the three names chosen were the same. In that case, it sends an alert saying that you won, and updates a win counter in the top left corner.
